# Gerrit on kubernetes 

This year I've had the opportunity to use gerrit in a kubernetes cluster 
to support some interesting workflows.

Running services in a containerisation scheduling environment increases 
application deployment density and opens opportunities for rapid 
iterations of software development and configuration testing.

In this talk we'll walk through an example of configuring gerrit in 
kubernetes explore some interesting use cases and how we used it to 
better understand our developers.
