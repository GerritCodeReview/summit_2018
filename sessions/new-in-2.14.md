# What's new in Gerrit 2.14.x

Overview of the new features included in Gerrit version 2.14.

Version 2.14 was released more than a year ago, so it's not "new"
any more. This presentation will be based on the
[same talk from the 2017 Summit in London](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2017/+/master/sessions/new-in-2.14.md),
and updated to cover the features that have been added in the maintenance
releases since then.
