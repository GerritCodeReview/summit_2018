# What's new in Gerrit 2.14.x and 2.15

[Slides](https://storage.cloud.google.com/gerrit-talks/summit/2018/whats-new-in-2.14-and-2.15-gus-2018.pdf)

Overview of the new features included in Gerrit version 2.14.

Version 2.14 was released more than a year ago, so it's not "new"
any more. This presentation will be based on the
[same talk from the 2017 Summit in London](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2017/+/master/sessions/new-in-2.14.md),
and updated to cover the features that have been added in the maintenance
releases since then.

I'll also briefly cover the main new features in 2.15, since
there isn't going to be a separate session for that this year. This
part will be based on Dave Borowitz's
[talk from the 2017 summit](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2017/+/master/sessions/new-in-2.15.md).
