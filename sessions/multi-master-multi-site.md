# Gerrit Multi-master and Multi-site: an OpenSource solution

Last year Qualcomm went live with a Gerrit multi-master setup. This year
GerritHub.io went multi-master and multi-site leveraging a series of
extensions of the high-availability plugin on top of Gerrit 2.15.

See how GerritHub.io has tackled the challenges and problems related
to a multi-site using standard Cloud providers and services and
OpenSource load-balancers and monitors.

Multi-site is a journey and GerritHub.io is in the middle of it.
Let's discuss our plans and see how your journey to multi-site
can benefit from GerritForge experience:

- What we have done in 2018
- What we plan to do with the high-availability extensions
- Sharding and multi-site
- What's left
- How does your multi-site plan look like?
