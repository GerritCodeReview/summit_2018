# Code review goes cloud native - Gerrit on Kubernetes and Gardener

SAP is running large Gerrit servers on premise and in the cloud. Last year
we started using containerized slaves and decided to go cloud native and
base our future Gerrit deployments on Kubernetes and leverage project Gardener
to support multiple cloud providers. Matthias Sohn will present and demo the
current work in progress and discuss plans.

We are looking for allies on this journey and think that Kubernetes has the
potential to become the standard deployment underlay for deploying Gerrit.
