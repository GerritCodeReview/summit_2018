# Gerrit 2.16, 3.0, and beyond

Gerrit 3.0 is coming! If you've tried 2.16, you may have already seen our new
database backend (NoteDb) and UI (PolyGerrit). With 2.16, these features are
better than ever; for 3.0, we're excited to delete thousands upon thousands of
lines from Gerrit's codebase. Join me for a tour of new features you can use
today, and a discussion about even more things to look forward to once we've
freed ourselves from the burden of some of our legacy code.
